It generally receives modest oak aging (around 12 months in 225L French oak, used 3 to 4 times), which tends to help the Xinomavro shine through. Granting that sensory memory is a fragile thing, this seemed to me rather different at this stage of its life than recent prior vintages, less round and civilized, a bit tighter, earthier, less fleshy, a trend I think that I have seen in some other 2009s. Indeed, Chief Oenologist Yiannis Voyatzis later wrote to me that the vintage led to wines with a bit more astringency and a bit less color and roundness. If you don't mind a little rusticity (or even prefer it), this worked it all out quite well. The oak was beautifully integrated early on, hardly affecting the wine at all. The light color, purity and earthy nose give this a very Nebbiolo feel, a very old world, old school sensibility, with fine acidity and intensity. It is excellent, traditional and well done in its own way and style. Some may prefer it; some might prefer the riper style of, say, the 2007. You may like both. I did.

I was surprised by the lusciousness of this cuvee on several occasions, and how much more forward it is given the fact that Las Cases can often be forebodingly backward and in need of 10-15 years of cellaring (at age 30, the 1982 is still a baby in terms of development!).

The vineyard is in the huge Vinemount Ridge sub-appellation, butting up against the Twenty Mile Bench on Moyer Road near Megalomaniac in Vineland. The vineyard benefits from its lofty, breezy perch on top of the Escarpment that keeps the fruit clean, dry and in pristine condition through harvest.

Sadly (or maybe fortunately) for me, I'm not old enough to have tasted the 1955 in 1958 from bottle, but this wine could also be an update on the more modern 2000 which, of course, I know well and actually own. This full-bodied, colossal giant of a wine is one of the goliaths of the vintage. It may well have the highest level of natural alcohol for any wine from the Left Bank of Bordeaux (15.1%) and has the definite potential to be a 50- to 75-year wine. Dense purple, it offers up notes of lead pencil shavings, charcoal embers, blueberry and blackberry liqueur along with massive concentration, a multi-dimensional mouthfeel and a monumental finish that goes well past a minute, which I think might be a record for a young Bordeaux. Keep in mind that the 2009, which I gave three digits, came in at 14.7%, but the pH of the 2010 is lower, giving the wine a freshness and precision that is remarkable. The final blend was 62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Merlot, and - unlike the Chapelle de la Mission, which has 26% Cabernet Franc - there's only 1% Cabernet Franc in the 2010 La Mission Haut-Brion.

It also misses the vibrancy of its ostensibly lesser sibling. 'For the reserve,' notes Chris Figgins, 'we look for lots that are more backward and brooding,' and he certainly was rewarded this year. Ripe, lightly-confitured cassis and mulberry are mingled with toasted nuts, peat, and dark Burley tobacco. High-toned suggestions of camphor, mint, and gentian distillate emerge with aeration. The amplitude and sheer fruit intensity here comes along with a palpable if well-coated tannic undergirding; and the finish splendidly soothes and sustains. The longer this was open to the air, the greater its appeal; and I'm only sorry I could not follow it for a second day. Look for at least 15 years of profound pleasure not to mention persistent contrast with the corresponding Cabernet bottling.  Score - 95.

Robust, the palate is based on a frame of fine, silky tannins and lingers on the fruity finish. A wine that is at once attractive and appealing, and one that will benefit from a further two to three years of aging. Score - 2 Stars (out of 3).

A lovely choice for rich cheeses and after-dinner sipping.","notes":"Talk about under-appreciated, Port is one of the most under-appreciated wines and yet can be some of the most balanced and beautiful - especially when matched with the right stinky cheese, a cigar, or a perfect evening. Allan Jackson (yes that Allan Jackson) loves Port and calls this 6 year in barrel Cabernet and Merlot based Tawny 'a labour of love' ... it's not just the dried cherry and cranberry that passes pleasantly over the palate - it has outstanding acidity to balance the sweetness - this elixir is a real beauty and stunning value for the price. For fun and freshness a small percentage of Syrah was added back into the blend before bottling - lifting the fruit a tad ... nice decision. One of the best Port-style wines to come out of Ontario, possibly ever. This style of wine is not only under-appreciated but this version is under-priced too (but shh, don't tell the Union).

But it's not the nose that'll impress you, it's the palate. It's the hit of spice, the robust red fruit and the spice. Yes I said spice twice cause that's the part that you'll remember.

It is a blend of 90% Assyrtiko, with 5% each of the typical blending grapes on the island, Athiri and Aidani. I had not been overly impressed with this bottling at one point. Yet, in back-to-back vintages, it is showing exceptionally well, its performance well exceeding its price point. There is really no reason it shouldn't excel, the winery's modest (compared to its upper level wines) notwithstanding. Don't let the screwcap turn you off. It is a bargain in the lineup and on the island. Stefanos Georgas, a winery representative, said to me that the vine age for the Atlantis white 'averages 50 years and are our young vines.' (He's really not kidding, but that is certainly not the norm for wines in this price level.) Grant that the blend means that this is not the biggest and most powerful wine in the lineup. However, it is no slouch, it has more personality than most and a high level of charm. Nice and ripe on opening and in its youth, it settles down with some air and shows considerable tension and grip on the finish. There is lurking power underneath in this wine's youth. It feels full in the mouth for a Santorini at this price level, with the solidity to go with the aromatics. There is a slight lemon-lime tinge on the finish. It likely won't last quite as long as some of the big boy wines, but it is quite impressive at the moment. It should be irresistible this summer. Drink now-2017. Score - 90.

This method was the norm of yesteryear, but is so labor intense that it was discontinued in most wineries, and gives a big diversity of wines, as each barrel has its own character, which contributes to the complexity of the blend. Furthermore, the bottled wine is on average 8 to 10 years old. One other thing that makes it apart from other Finos is that the grapes are exclusively from the high part of the Macharnudo vineyard, so this is a single-vineyard Fino.

I think this has worked fabulously well with the cassis quality fruit they get from their Cabernet Sauvignon. The full-bodied, powerful 2006 possesses extraordinary purity and clarity. A large-scaled, massive Mouton Rothschild that ranks as one of the top four or five wines of the vintage, it may turn out to be the longest-lived wine of the vintage by a landslide. The label will undoubtedly be controversial as a relative of Sigmund Freud, Lucian Freud, has painted a rather comical Zebra staring aimlessly at what appears to be a palm tree in the middle of a stark courtyard. I suppose a psychiatrist could figure out the relationship between that artwork and wine, but I couldn't see one. This utterly profound Mouton will need to sleep for 15+ years before it will reveal any secondary nuances, but it is a packed and stacked first-growth Pauillac of enormous potential.

The wines are noted for their structure, aromatics and complex black fruit flavours. Traditionally Grenache and Mourvèdre, Rasteau has seen an increase in the use of Syrah, which adds floral and spice notes to the final blend.","notes":"Black cherry and pistachio aromas, gamey, exciting.
