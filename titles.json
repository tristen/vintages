It generally receives modest oak aging (around 12 months in 225L French oak, used 3 to 4 times), which tends to help the Xinomavro shine through. Granting that sensory memory is a fragile thing, this seemed to me rather different at this stage of its life than recent prior vintages, less round and civilized, a bit tighter, earthier, less fleshy, a trend I think that I have seen in some other 2009s. Indeed, Chief Oenologist Yiannis Voyatzis later wrote to me that the vintage led to wines with a bit more astringency and a bit less color and roundness. If you don't mind a little rusticity (or even prefer it), this worked it all out quite well. The oak was beautifully integrated early on, hardly affecting the wine at all. The light color, purity and earthy nose give this a very Nebbiolo feel, a very old world, old school sensibility, with fine acidity and intensity. It is excellent, traditional and well done in its own way and style. Some may prefer it; some might prefer the riper style of, say, the 2007. You may like both. I did.

This is a beautifully constructed Post Scriptum, elegant and graceful, yet focused, precise and flavorful. It is designed to have all of its parts in place, not to make you go 'wow.' Aromatic and laced with floral nuances, it has a sappy taste in its youth, with some tannin pop and astringency on the finish that will integrate in time. This should develop well and drink decently early on, but give it a year or two in the cellar to settle down for best results.

One would have to go back to the 2005, 1947 or 1961 to find this level of quality from this ancient, historic vineyard planted adjacent to the walls of St.-Emilion, on the Cote Pavie. Dating back to the 1400s, this estate has been owned for over three centuries by the Malet-Roquefort family. Composed of 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc (in the past it was two-thirds Merlot and the rest split between Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc), the 2009 reveals compelling elegance, tremendous intensity and opulence and more viscosity than one normally sees. Lots of kirsch, licorice, incense, truffle, asphalt, blackberry and cassis notes dominate the aromatics and flavors of this full-bodied, viscous, fabulously pure, flamboyant St.-Emilion. Drinking it now may be considered infanticide by some consumers, but it is already attractive, and should last for 3-4 decades. Score - 95+.

I really like La Roverina valpolicella with its core of fresh, ripe dark and red berry fruits; it's full of spice, pepper and an attractive woodsy character, dried herbs too that mingle on the palate.

The vineyard is in the huge Vinemount Ridge sub-appellation, butting up against the Twenty Mile Bench on Moyer Road near Megalomaniac in Vineland. The vineyard benefits from its lofty, breezy perch on top of the Escarpment that keeps the fruit clean, dry and in pristine condition through harvest. The 2011 vintage is remarkable from the first sniff; rich, layered citrus fruit, savoury-herbal notes, a touch of jasmine and ginger, grapefruit, lanolin and that distinct wet stone note.

Dense purple, it offers up notes of lead pencil shavings, charcoal embers, blueberry and blackberry liqueur along with massive concentration, a multi-dimensional mouthfeel and a monumental finish that goes well past a minute, which I think might be a record for a young Bordeaux.

I had visited the 2010 Petrus about an hour before I had La Fleur Petrus. I was dumbfounded - it appeared to have a character nearly identical to the great Petrus! The fabulous 2010 La Fleur Petrus boasts a dense purple color in addition to a big, sweet perfume of mocha-infused black raspberry and black cherry fruit that is extravagantly rich, textured and long. Super-pure, deep and full-bodied, this remarkable wine will be one for the history books. The tannins are elevated, but the depth of fruit and richness are amazing. For those who will never be able to afford a bottle of Petrus, this is about as close as one can get to the aromas and flavors of that mythical wine. It should drink well for three decades or more.

Interestingly, too, Petit Verdot vines have contributed a significant share of each earlier Reserve bottling since their first crop, 2000, but this year dropped out on account of having been hit by the late frost. While at 14.7% virtually identical in alcohol to the corresponding Cabernet Sauvignon bottling, this 2009 Reserve comes off as significantly fuller-bodied. It also misses the vibrancy of its ostensibly lesser sibling. 'For the reserve,' notes Chris Figgins, 'we look for lots that are more backward and brooding,' and he certainly was rewarded this year. Ripe, lightly-confitured cassis and mulberry are mingled with toasted nuts, peat, and dark Burley tobacco. High-toned suggestions of camphor, mint, and gentian distillate emerge with aeration.

(He's really not kidding, but that is certainly not the norm for wines in this price level.) Grant that the blend means that this is not the biggest and most powerful wine in the lineup. However, it is no slouch, it has more personality than most and a high level of charm. Nice and ripe on opening and in its youth, it settles down with some air and shows considerable tension and grip on the finish. There is lurking power underneath in this wine's youth.

This method was the norm of yesteryear, but is so labor intense that it was discontinued in most wineries, and gives a big diversity of wines, as each barrel has its own character, which contributes to the complexity of the blend. Furthermore, the bottled wine is on average 8 to 10 years old. One other thing that makes it apart from other Finos is that the grapes are exclusively from the high part of the Macharnudo vineyard, so this is a single-vineyard Fino.

Here is a classic instance of virtually 100% new wood at this estate scarcely sapping textural allure or primary juiciness, a phenomenon that de Castelnau is more inclined to attribute to the quality of grape tannins and sheer extract of vinous raw material that results from long but gentle, watchful fermentative extraction (usually followed by malo) as opposed to crediting the provenance or treatment of the estate's barrels (though surely these represent a glove-fit). 'The wine has to be completely constructed before going to barrel' is how he puts it, echoing Jean-Marie Guffens' well-known and far more than just clever adage that 'a wine can take as much new wood as it doesn't need.'
